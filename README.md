# Random Sticky

Opens a randomly coloured sticky note on Mac OS. I use a lot of notes and it's hard to tell them apart if they're the same colour.

## How to set up

1. From the terminal, run `make install`
2. You'll need to add the "Random Sticky" app to System Preferences => Security & Privacy => Privacy => Accessibility (as it must be able to send keystrokes to the Stickies app)
